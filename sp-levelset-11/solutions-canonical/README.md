## Supaplex Levelset 11 -- Canonical solutions


### Notes
Author's solution to level 08 is invalid -- embedded level differs from the one from levelset (has sniksnak instead of base in one of the cells).
A solution by HPerk is the canonical one instead.

Author's solution to level 08 is not present -- solution by HPerk is the canonical one instead.

Author's solution to level 28 is unjustifiably long, and can't be canonical -- solution by HPerk is the canonical one instead.
